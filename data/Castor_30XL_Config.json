  "Description": "The CASTOR 30XL is more than a stretched version of the CASTOR 30. The motor is 235.8 inches long and nominally designed as an upper stage that can function as a second or third stage depending on the vehicle configuration. The nozzle is 8 feet long with a submerged design with a high-performance expansion ratio (55.9:1) and a dual density exit cone well suited for high altitude operation. It features an electro-mechanical TVA system with actuators, thermal battery and electronic controller.",
