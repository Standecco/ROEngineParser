  "Description": "The STAR 63, as part of the PAM DII upper stage, has been flown from the Space Shuttle. The motor utilizes a head-end web and a carbon-phenolic nozzle. The case material is a Kevlar-epoxy composite, through future motors would be made using a graphiteepoxy composite. Testing of STAR 63 series motors began in 1978 with completion of the PAM DII motor qualification in 1985. The first STAR 63D flight was from the Shuttle in November 1985 to place a defense communication satellite in orbit.",
