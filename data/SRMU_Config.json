  "Description": "The Titan IVB Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade (SRMU, also know as the Upgraded Solid Rocket Motor or USRM), was developed with the goal of achieving a 25% increase in capacity over the Titan IVA with the UA1207 SRM. It achieved this through the use of a more energetic propellant and a 3-segment composite case that carried more fuel and weighed less than the UA1207's 7-segment steel case. Burn time 150 seconds.",
