  "Description": "This STAR motor was developed and tested in January 2000 under a NASA Goddard Space Flight Center program for a low-cost, high mass fraction orbit adjust motor for use in deploying constellations of very small satellites (nanosatellites). The first static test of the STAR 4G prototype motor was conducted 8 months after program start. The motor is designed to operate at high chamber pressure and incorporates a noneroding throat insert to maximize specific impulse.",
