  "Manufacturer": "Aerojet Rocketdyne",
  "Description": "Low thrust pump-fed expander nuclear engine. Evolved from the original NERVA design the Bimodal NTR, instead of wasting precious propellant mass for cooling the engine reactor, uses a Brayton cycle electricity generator unit to convert the waste thermal energy into useful electrical power. It also supports liquid oxygen injection (TRITON - trimodal operation) for increased thrust but with the cost of a lower overall efficiency.",
