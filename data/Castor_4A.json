  "Description": "The Castor 4A was introduced on the first generation of Delta II launchers, the 6000-series, and offered improved thrust and specific impulse by replacing PBAA with higher energy HTPB. This, combined with a stretched first stage (the Extra-Extended Long Tank Thor) and a return to the more efficient 6-3 SRM ignition sequence, improved Delta's performance by 11% over the 3000-series. The Castor 4A was flown on the Delta II from 1989 until 1993, when it was replaced by the GEM 40. The boosters were also used on the Atlas IIAS from 1993 until 2004. Burn time 53 seconds.",
