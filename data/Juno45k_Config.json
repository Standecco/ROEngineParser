  "Manufacturer": "JPL",
  "Description": "When work began on successors to the early Juno launch vehicles, there was an obvious demand for higher performance engines. In order to satisfy this demand, JPL worked on a second stage engine for the Juno IV launch vehicle that would provide 45,000 pounds of thrust in vacuum. The engines were tested, but they were ultimately decided against using them in favor of the X-405 of the Vanguard launch vehicle.",
